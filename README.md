# My Studel Application
First, one main quirk of my application  
The second test player will only work after the main player has started playing  
Another quirk, the Strudel Editor Environment will only import changes after a change has been made in the editor text area  

# Video Link

Mono and Stereo does not come out of the video that nicely, many retakes were done but it would not come out properly  
Most likely an issue with Panopto  

# Controls
Volume Slider changes the volume of the strudel environment  
Player Controls Stop and Start the Song  
Music Modifiers currently has two modifiers  
- Low Pass Filter
- High Pass Filter
When selected, and the music player is playing, they will apply either of these filters  
CPM Input changes the CPM of the song onBlur (When the text isn't in focus anymore)
